## 📈 **Key Insights & Business Findings**  

📌 **Profitability Concerns:**  
- **Sales revenue peaked in 2018**, but **profit margins hit a 4-year low** at **6%** (down from 17% in 2016).  
- **Heavy discounting was the primary driver of profit decline** across multiple states.  

📌 **State-Level Profit Disparities:**  
- A **$100K profit gap** exists between **top-performing (California)** and **lowest-performing (Texas)** states.  

📌 **Discounting’s Impact on Profits:**  
- **Negative correlation found** between **discount percentage and profit margin**.  
- **Key product subcategories** with high discounts & negative profit margins:
